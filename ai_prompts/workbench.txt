create a cartoon image of a workbench that a mad scientist would use as seen from the top looking down. it should have a fun style. the whole front half of the desk needs to be empty except for two very large separate pages of paper that are side by side for notes that take up most of the front of the desk. along the back of the desk it should have things like beakers and small inventions and widgets. there should be a man sitting in the chair at the front of the desk
